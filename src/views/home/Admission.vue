         <span class="d-block">Registration</span>
         <p class="my-2">
             Students who are admitted to any programs of the College must register for
             the course to be taken in each semester. After a student is admitted to one 
             of the programs of the College, the next thing to do is registration for a set
             of courses. This has to be done before attending any class/lecture.
         </p>
         <p>
             The student should go to his/her academic advisor, collect registration 
             slips, fill the required information on the registration slip, get it 
             signed by the advisor and go to the College registrar office with the 
             duly signed slips. The College registrar then registers the student, 
             renew the ID card and give back a copy of the registration slip to the 
             student. A student may be asked to present his/her registration slip by 
             any of the offices providing student services. For that purpose, the 
             student should keep one copy of the registration slip with him/her. The 
             registrar office indicates the dates on the academic calendar of the 
             College in which a student should register. It is therefore strongly 
             advised that a student regularly consults the academic calendar which
              will be posted on notice boards of the registrar offices or the College 
              website. Registration has to be done every semester. Registration by proxy
               is not allowed. Students shall pay the tuition and the application fees 
               before registering for courses.
