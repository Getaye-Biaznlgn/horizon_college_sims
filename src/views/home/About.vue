     Our College has recorded enormous remarkable achievements in the past twelve years. Since its establishment, it has graduated thousands of competent professionals in
     various fields, programs, and levels; and as a result, has contributed its best to overall development endeavours of the country. To realize its vision: “Horizon College 
     aspires to be the top ten universities in Ethiopia by 2027,” the College has designed a five year’s Strategic Plan which would enable it to run several things.
